            <p style="margin: 10px;">The Dallas Mavericks took a commanding 2-0 series lead over the Minnesota Timberwolves on the road, and after climbing the mountain and battling back after being down by 18 points, the Mavs got the win. <br><br>

                Both Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving hit big shots down the stretch, but no shot was bigger than Doncic's game-winning step-back 3-pointer over Rudy Gobert that anyone in the stadium could have seen what was coming. <br><br>
                Doncic and Gobert have an individual rivalry that has been going on for multiple seasons now, but no moment encompasses Doncic's domination of Gobert like the game-winning 3-pointer he made over him in the Western Conference Finals.

        <h3>Quote of the Season</h3>
        <blockquote>
            <strong>"Everybody acting tough when they up." -- Luka Dončić</strong>
        </blockquote><hr>
        <p> This quote from Luka will be remembered for ages. In the Western Conference Semifinal, 2 years ago, Luka said these words after humiliating the suns 123 - 90. The Suns were 2-0 up and many thoght that it is impossible for the dallas maverics to comeback in the semifinals. Many experts have written of luka and his team but astonishingly the Mavs made a stellar comeback and defeated the suns 4 - 3. </p>
